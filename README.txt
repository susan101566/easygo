Application Name: Easy Go

Project Description: 

This is an android 2.3.3 application. 
It is often frustrating to stand at a bus stop, not knowing when the next 61D will arrive. 
Google maps is often the option. However, what if one only has access to slow internet, or none at all? 
This is an offline application that allows users to check the closest bus schedule. 

Given the 
bus name, (61ABCD, 71ABCD, 28X)
the direction of the bus(outbound or inboud),  
the stop id or name (Fifth at Neville, for example), 
the time you wish to arrive at the stop (or depart from the stop), 

The application will find the closest available schedule that Port Authority offers. 

All code, images are original. 
Database is parsed from the txt files publically available on the Pittsburgh Port Authority developers' website at, 
https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference

For simplicity, the database included only contains 61ABCD, 71ABCD, 28X, i.e. the buses that I personally ride oftenly. 
This makes the application smaller (2+ MB instead of 50+ MB).
